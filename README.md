# Corre Romualdo
Corre Romualdo is a small project that began as a practice of basic Python concepts and gradually became more complex and bigger.
It this adventure we have to travel and guide Romualdo, a survivor in an apocalyptic future full of zombies... Nothing very innovative about this.
At the beginning, our friend Romualdo has 100% life, is 0% tired and 20% hungry. Then we have to choose between 2 possible paths to follow and we can see a clue about what lies ahead, but beware! theyâ€™re not always right, and we might end up in trouble...
As we move forward and encounter inconveniences along the way, the life, tiredness and hunger change, and they may give us a hard time!
You can find pirates, families, drunkards, cannibals and even puppies!

Join Romualdo and see how far you can go together!
